      <h2>about</h2>
      <p> Francisco makes interactive spaces and narratives that are grounded in his lived experience. His work celebrates the detail and aesthetics of everyday existence by providing spaces to explore and play that enkindle an appreciation for our shared reality. This has taken the form of experimental videogames, but also designed space/performance. </p>
    <p> Fran plans on putting up a CV here, with a concrete list of things he's done, but he hasn't gotten around to it yet. </p>
