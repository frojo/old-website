      fran feels that there isn't enough space in modern society for people to personally express themselves
      he works to communicate his feelings and grow and maintain a healthy connection
      fran tries to spend his time focusing on the good things that modern technology have brought
      * the ability to create interactive expriences, 
      * the ability of systems 
    *
      apps or platforms that promise connection and socialization but do the opposite. you'd think that in 2020, this would be a commonly agreed upon--and it more or less is--but i believe these platforms, explicitly Facebook, Twitter, still haven't made up my mind on Instagram, have actually done more harm than good.
      
      although fran feels angry much of the time, he believes the world

    i have too moods: cynical and what's-the-point-in-anything and earnest and 
    tender. my work tends to be oscillate between the two
    i'm currently still getting my bearings in a new city

    it takes too much time to make something work, i usually don't have the
    energy to make it pretty as well
